#Shrek
**Shrek** is the best movie for me.
> All shrek movies are really a banger.
1. Shrek 1 basically is about being knight and shining armor and loving yourself.
2. Shrek 2 is fighting for your love and accepting difference of everyone.
3. Shrek 3 is being what you are and you can define yourself.
4. Shrek 4 is don't regret from your past, instead learn from it. Also love can come in different ways.
